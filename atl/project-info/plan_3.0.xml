			<html:div>
				ATL produce maintenance releases to align with the Ganymede
				Service
				Releases
				which includes the Eclipse Platform's 3.4.1
				and 3.4.2
				releases. Maintenance releases will only be published if they
				contain new fixes.
			</html:div>

	<target_environments>
		<html:div>
			In order to remain current, each Eclipse release targets
			reasonably
			current versions of the underlying operating environments.
			The ATL
			project depends upon on the Platform and other projects, which
			are
			mostly "pure" Java. The 3.5 release of the Eclipse Platform
			Project
			is written and compiled against version 1.4 of the Java
			Platform
			APIs, and targeted to run on version 1.4 of the Java Runtime
			Environment, Standard Edition. ATL will target the same Java version
			as the platform.
		</html:div>
		<internationalization>
			<html:div>
				The Eclipse Platform is designed as the basis for
				internationalized
				products. The user interface elements provided by
				the Eclipse SDK
				components, including dialogs and error messages, are
				externalized.
				The English strings are provided as the default
				resource bundles. As
				a result, the ATL project will provide English
				strings in its
				default bundles and be localized to a subset of those
				locales
				offered by the Platform. This plan will be updated to
				indicate which
				locales will be provided and the time frame for
				availability.
			</html:div>
		</internationalization>

	<compatibility_with_previous_releases>
		<html:div>We plan to change the API in the ATL 3.0 release but the
			ATL language compatibility will be preserved.</html:div>
